        <h1>about</h1>
        <p>How often do you ask, “What should I eat today?” People generally eat three meals a day and asking this question every day, multiple times a day can be exhausting. 
            Realizing that this is a question that must be answered every day for the rest of your life is an overwhelming realization. </p>
        <p>An online survey conducted by OnePoll found that 42% of respondents stare at the fridge hoping for dinner ideas and 48% hope that the cupboard provides ideas. </p>

        <p>Respondents waste around 43 minutes a day or 37 hours a year trying to figure out what to eat — a whole working week (Lumley, 2024). </p>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; flex-wrap: wrap; margin-top: 40px;">

        <p>This is a lot of time and mental energy used. 
            In addition to all the other decisions we have to make throughout the day, people can feel mentally overloaded and find it more difficult to make additional decisions – this is decision fatigue. </p>
        <p>The consequences of decision fatigue may lead to people feeling tired, having brain fog, or other symptoms of mental and physical fatigue. Fortunately, a major way of overcoming decision fatigue is to make fewer decisions (AMA, 2021). </p>
        <p>The goal of this website is for users to make only a few basic choices and then be suggested a recipe. The website uses the MealDB API which provides access to a database of a wide variety of recipes. </p>
